2 TrisectedWords	clues	phrase
2 Anacrostic		clues	phrase

April 2nd - started at 1:21, completed at... 2:34? But not with all puzzles.

Change heading in puzzle pyramid from "For <Date>" to "For week <date> - <date + 6>"
ENHANCEMENT: Word Squares could support phrases (where each word is 5 letters or fewer) with multiple grids.

HtmlGenerator.AppendSolution - use <nobr> tags and &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; between words instead of <br>

Fix replacement with subtrings issue. What if "solution" or "solve" were one of the replaced words?
Also replace uppercase phrases "Living" vs "living"

Add PhraseSegment puzzle without a specific date and without "Anonymous"
Multiple Clues does not work with the letter "Y". (maybe because it was upper case?)

Add bool CanSupportSolution(string potentialSolution) to IPuzzle interface. Use lengths below


Set a RandomNumberSeed for all puzzles inside a pyramid. Use it for the randomizer when constructing the puzzle set, too. 


Add Support for Puzzle X - bonus puzzle, second quote by same person. 

Add qualifier for person (author, singer, writer, youTuber, etc.)

Extract shared method from FormatHtmlForGoogle tests (to generate and compare files with and without solutions)

Puzzle Length range
Most clues per puzzle = about 12
12 letter phrase to test with
3: men
5: tests
10: strawberry
12: abbreviation
15: Acknowledgement
20: semiautobiographical
25: areeareotioeaermnamensoie
29: areeareotioeaermnamensoiestre
32: quinquagintaquadringentilliardth
10: seven words
12: four word test

3 - 5	MultipleClues	word 	Multiple clues per letter

3 - 5 	Word Square	word	1 clue per letter *could be multiples
	(only a few clues, so not good for I J K puzzles)

6 - 12	ReadDownColumn	phrase 1 clue per letter
	(want at least 4 clues, but not more than 12 (not counting spaces and symbols))
6 - 12 	WordSearch	phrase
	(min of 6 because you want to have some words cross each other)
	(no clues, so it can't be a mid-level (J, K, L) puzzle)
6 - 15 	Letters+Arrows	phrase* (needs bugfix)
	(for each letter in the solution, need 3 other letters - solution is like 25% density, I'm guessing)
	(can't fit 12 in a 7x7 grid, so less than 12/49 density (which would be about 25%)
	(let's try for 20% density - dividing by 5 instead, which would have a max of 10)
	(actually, the problem with the above was the spaces in the phrase, see bug elsewhere)
	(12 letter "abbreviation" fits in a 5x5 square, so density is more like 50%)
	(implies that an 8x8 grid = 64 letters could support a 32 letter word.)
	(nope - let's try 25 as the max?)
	(15 letter "Acknowledgement" fits in a 6x6 square. Lots of factors here)

	(4x4 grid = 16 / 4 = 4 letters, min)
	(6x6 grid = 36 /4 = 9 letters, max - maybe we can stretch to 12. )
	(Or we could add 7x7 support )

10 - 36	TrisectedWords	phrase	1-3 letters per clue
10 - 48	Anacrostic	phrase	1 clue per word in original phrase
	(want at least 3 words, 4 letter each = min 12 letters)
	(say, 4 letters per word in the phrase, 12 words max = 48)

32 -999	PhraseSegment	phrase
	(no clues, so it can't be a mid-level (J, K, L) puzzle)
	(minimum = 8 (4+4) rows * 4 columns = 32)
	(no actual maximum size - will break into 100 letter subphrases as necessary)


In 9 IPuzzle Types
	Implement         List<string> GetClues();
	Implement        void ReplaceClue(string clueToReplace, string newClue);

Add unit tests for (non-default) implementations
Fix bug - Original Word from InnerAnacrosticPuzzle.PuzzleWord is lost when serialized/deserialized.

NEXT: Change from pre-set list of puzzle types in pyramid to letting the user choose.
	Keep a list of preferred options (random to start with, then move used puzzle types to the bottom)
	Only display options appropriate to the solution (e.g. not anacrostic for short solutions)
	Display which puzzle is being worked on. 
	Allow user to skip puzzles (press enter)


Fix bug with "wise" being replaced as a substring of "otherwise". 

Fix bug where text all shows as red if you select the last word in a quote (never resets to grey)
Add phrase support to Multiple Clues

MultipleClues
	Force clue swap between 0th index word and another random word (0th index doesn't always get swapped).

Puzzle idea: overlapping tents of letters and holes. 
	Generate images of all upper case letters, all letters flipped 180 degrees, and scissors icon. 
	Perfect for 4-letter words. 
	Pick random words before or after the solution. 

Group puzzles into months
	Collection: Year of puzzles (Dictionary<dateTime, IPuzzle>)
	Placeholders for days where we know the solution, but not the puzzle? Null puzzle type? 
	"Which month do you want to work on?" "Ok, which day?" "Ok, is <> still the solution for that day?"
	Update WordPuzzleGenerator to produce month of puzzles (and month of solutions)
	Capture partially-filled month of puzzles. 
	Placeholder for month or year-long puzzle solutions (e.g. fill in the blanks for Days of week, phases of moon, etc.)

Add instructions to PhraseSegmentPuzzle
Add instructions to HiddenRelatedWords



Should add support for SpecialCharacter (and Reason) to other puzzles, too. 

Add new puzzle types.
NEW PUZZLE: Remove the letter A from a word, anagram the remaining letters, and use it a clue for the original word. 
	e.g. (Adding A): "Don't try to carry everything without a platter: _ _ A _" Solution: TRAY (anagram try)

NEW PUZZLE: Print out strips of letters, cut them into bands, and rotate and arrange them until 
they form 3-letter words. Papercraft puzzle. Check to see how difficult/interesting it is. 


Tests probably take a long time because of initializing the various Repositories. 
	Create a single repository of each type for all tests could share.
	Ignore tests taking over 3 seconds. 

Convert remaining puzzles
2. Sudoku
8. Building Blocks
9. Related Words (see new puzzle)

Convert remaining puzzles
Q. Missing Letters
7. Hidden Words (see new puzzle)
4. Word Ladder

Maybe Word Ladder is a better puzzle than I thought. 

Read Down Columns should be updated to be any length (4-7?) and the solution can be hidden in any column. 

Review todo below this line.

HTMLFormatter (common code)
	Create table cells

Fix copy/pasted code in  Weekly Puzzle executable. Share code from Puzzle Generator instead.

List of tests that occassionally time out
	EndingWith_D_FindsAtLeastOnePuzzle
	SimpleTest_PutsWordInExpectedPosition

List of tests that occassionally fail. 
	PopulatesExpectedLetters [TestCase("abcdefghijkl")]

WordSearchMoreOrLess
	CardinalDirections preference could be made stronger by starting with the desired direction, and then finding coordinates (if they exist) that support that direction. 

Consider breaking "all_clues.json" into multiple files to make it easier to save, load, and see differences.
