All tests are passing, let's check in!

Include clues in puzzle. 
	Clues should have a type enum to indicate their source. 
	Refactor clues from strings to objects. 
	Found that I already have a "Clue" object, with serialization (to XML)
	Creating a NewClue object instead. Will have to merge them later. 

Create a PUZ parser (quick nuget search = no parsers commonly available (proprietary format))

Write a program to parse files from a directory. 
Write a program to populate the directory from different sources.

Merge NewClue/Clue

Generate solution as HTML

Already have an example for "Puzzle" - 

Rename "Puzzle" to a more descriptive name. 
Serialize/Deserialize all puzzles to JSON

Create a general puzzle object. 

Add new puzzle types.

List of tests that occassionally time out
	EndingWith_D_FindsAtLeastOnePuzzle
	SimpleTest_PutsWordInExpectedPosition
List of tests that occassionally fail. 
	PopulatesExpectedLetters [TestCase("abcdefghijkl")]

--- DONE (most recent on top)

Need a clue repository. Could be...
	From local files
	From Google Sheet (hard to update)

Add test to generate HTML for Letters and Arrows Puzzle.
Render a puzzle as HTML that can be imported into Google Docs seamlessly. 
    <td width="250">Clue for ONES</td>
    <td width="20"> <sup>3â†“</sup><br/>&nbsp;</td>
	Make solution underscore spaces bold. Or h2.  

How to test generated HTML (that can change often?)
	1. Generate HTML
	2. Compare to known file. 
	3. If they are different, generate a new file with the  new results. 
	4. Create *something* (a test?) that will replace the old known file with the new results (Prompt - Are you sure?)
