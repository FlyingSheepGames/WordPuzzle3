TASKS
------------------------------
Next source of clues: Idioms ("raining cats and ___")

MultipleClues
	Force clue swap between 0th index word and another random word (0th index doesn't always get swapped).

Puzzle idea: overlapping tents of letters and holes. 
	Generate images of all upper case letters, all letters flipped 180 degrees, and scissors icon. 
	Perfect for 4-letter words. 
	Pick random words before or after the solution. 

Group puzzles into months
	Collection: Year of puzzles (Dictionary<dateTime, IPuzzle>)
	Placeholders for days where we know the solution, but not the puzzle? Null puzzle type? 
	"Which month do you want to work on?" "Ok, which day?" "Ok, is <> still the solution for that day?"
	Update WordPuzzleGenerator to produce month of puzzles (and month of solutions)
	Capture partially-filled month of puzzles. 
	Placeholder for month or year-long puzzle solutions (e.g. fill in the blanks for Days of week, phases of moon, etc.)

Add instructions to PhraseSegmentPuzzle
Add instructions to HiddenRelatedWords

Add method to Clue Repository for Deleting a clue. 
	Update Puzzle Generator to allow user to delete clues as well. Maybe a special mode.
	Consider breaking "all_clues.json" into multiple files to make it easier to save, load, and see differences.

Should add support for SpecialCharacter (and Reason) to other puzzles, too. 

Add new puzzle types.
NEW PUZZLE: Remove the letter A from a word, anagram the remaining letters, and use it a clue for the original word. 
	e.g. (Adding A): "Don't try to carry everything without a platter: _ _ A _" Solution: TRAY (anagram try)

NEW PUZZLE: Print out strips of letters, cut them into bands, and rotate and arrange them until 
they form 3-letter words. Papercraft puzzle. Check to see how difficult/interesting it is. 


Tests probably take a long time because of initializing the various Repositories. 
	Create a single repository of each type for all tests could share.
	Ignore tests taking over 3 seconds. 

Convert remaining puzzles
2. Sudoku
8. Building Blocks
9. Related Words (see new puzzle)

Convert remaining puzzles
Q. Missing Letters
7. Hidden Words (see new puzzle)
4. Word Ladder

Maybe Word Ladder is a better puzzle than I thought. 

Read Down Columns should be updated to be any length (4-7?) and the solution can be hidden in any column. 

Review todo below this line.

HTMLFormatter (common code)
	Create table cells

Fix copy/pasted code in  Weekly Puzzle executable. Share code from Puzzle Generator instead.
