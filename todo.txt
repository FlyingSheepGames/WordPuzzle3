In 9 IPuzzle Types
	Implement         List<string> GetClues();
	Implement        void ReplaceClue(string clueToReplace, string newClue);

Add unit tests for (non-default) implementations

NEXT: Change from pre-set list of puzzle types in pyramid to letting the user choose.
	Keep a list of preferred options (random to start with, then move used puzzle types to the bottom)
	Only display options appropriate to the solution (e.g. not anacrostic for short solutions)
	Display which puzzle is being worked on. 
	Allow user to skip puzzles (press enter)


Fix bug with "wise" being replaced as a substring of "otherwise". 

Add phrase support to Multiple Clues

MultipleClues
	Force clue swap between 0th index word and another random word (0th index doesn't always get swapped).

Puzzle idea: overlapping tents of letters and holes. 
	Generate images of all upper case letters, all letters flipped 180 degrees, and scissors icon. 
	Perfect for 4-letter words. 
	Pick random words before or after the solution. 

Group puzzles into months
	Collection: Year of puzzles (Dictionary<dateTime, IPuzzle>)
	Placeholders for days where we know the solution, but not the puzzle? Null puzzle type? 
	"Which month do you want to work on?" "Ok, which day?" "Ok, is <> still the solution for that day?"
	Update WordPuzzleGenerator to produce month of puzzles (and month of solutions)
	Capture partially-filled month of puzzles. 
	Placeholder for month or year-long puzzle solutions (e.g. fill in the blanks for Days of week, phases of moon, etc.)

Add instructions to PhraseSegmentPuzzle
Add instructions to HiddenRelatedWords



Should add support for SpecialCharacter (and Reason) to other puzzles, too. 

Add new puzzle types.
NEW PUZZLE: Remove the letter A from a word, anagram the remaining letters, and use it a clue for the original word. 
	e.g. (Adding A): "Don't try to carry everything without a platter: _ _ A _" Solution: TRAY (anagram try)

NEW PUZZLE: Print out strips of letters, cut them into bands, and rotate and arrange them until 
they form 3-letter words. Papercraft puzzle. Check to see how difficult/interesting it is. 


Tests probably take a long time because of initializing the various Repositories. 
	Create a single repository of each type for all tests could share.
	Ignore tests taking over 3 seconds. 

Convert remaining puzzles
2. Sudoku
8. Building Blocks
9. Related Words (see new puzzle)

Convert remaining puzzles
Q. Missing Letters
7. Hidden Words (see new puzzle)
4. Word Ladder

Maybe Word Ladder is a better puzzle than I thought. 

Read Down Columns should be updated to be any length (4-7?) and the solution can be hidden in any column. 

Review todo below this line.

HTMLFormatter (common code)
	Create table cells

Fix copy/pasted code in  Weekly Puzzle executable. Share code from Puzzle Generator instead.

Other Birthdays
	(Actors) what movies were they in?

	(Musicians) what songs did they perform?

List of tests that occassionally time out
	EndingWith_D_FindsAtLeastOnePuzzle
	SimpleTest_PutsWordInExpectedPosition

List of tests that occassionally fail. 
	PopulatesExpectedLetters [TestCase("abcdefghijkl")]

WordSearchMoreOrLess
	CardinalDirections preference could be made stronger by starting with the desired direction, and then finding coordinates (if they exist) that support that direction. 

Consider breaking "all_clues.json" into multiple files to make it easier to save, load, and see differences.
